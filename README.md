# Mentorship Diary Application

Our project brief was to build an app that would enhance the School of Code mentoring experience and the solution that the team of 4 people I was working in, managed to come up with in less than a week was this tool that allows [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) bootcampers to track and document their mentor/mentee relantionship.This is basically an online diary of the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) bootcamper mentorship journey.

The application consist of a **Home** page:

**Weekly Form** where mentee can go through a predefine set of questions together with their mentor.The questions are set with placeholder text to help guide the discussion.

The data can be viewed on the **Achievement History** page by selecting the prefered week to review.
