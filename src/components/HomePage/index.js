            As we embark on this exciting and nerve-wracking experience,
            remember that everyone had to start somewhere. By embracing the
            relationship with your mentor you will learn to focus on your goals
            and help you to see how the subjects you are studying now will help
            your career in the future. It is also an incredible opportunity to
            extend your professional network and learn to engage with
            established members of the tech community.
